#  DLL compilation for VS with an R access example

DLL compilation for the Windows VS compiler is now working. Enter the following command at the command line in the directory in which you save these files: admb - d simple. Open the R gui in the same directory and issue this command: source("simple.r"). Then look at the ouput object: xx

![File text/x-perl][1] [simple.tpl][2]
:  A very simple example of a TPL used to create a DLL.

![File][1] [simple.r][3]
:  A simple R script used to access the objects inside a DLL created from simple.tpl
