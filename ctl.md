#  Control Files

Documentation of the LUP vector, an improvement in ADMB (rev1509, 2014-01-15) that makes it easier to specify parameter bounds and phases in 'control files'.

[example][1]
:  Steve Martell's proof of concept

[pella][2]
:  Three files from Arni Magnsson's old Pella-Tomlinson model (pella.dat was hake_schaefer.dat)

[pella2][3]
:  Same model as the above pella, but uses new overloaded init_bounded_number() that now accepts vector argument
