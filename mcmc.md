#  MCMC

Ongoing development towards MCMC improvements

![File][1] [Presentation on MCMC options][2]
:  Cole Monnahan, Jim Thorson, and Ian Taylor gave a talk (Feb-27-2013) detailing options for MCMC in ADMB, and when and how they should be used. Shows the mcrb and mcprobe algorithms, as well as demonstrating the MCMCMC and hybrid methods.

[Updating the MCMC documentation][3]
:  Ideas for improvements/clarifications for the existing documentation on MCMC methods.

![File chemical/x-molconn-Z][1] [MCMC Guide for ADMB][4]
:  The goal of this guide is to outline and describe the steps needed to conduct a Bayesian analysis in AD Model Builder. Included are general descriptions of Bayesian inference, priors, work flow and two built-in MCMC algorithms. We hope that the guide will enable users to take full advantage of the features of ADMB that are built in, but not yet well documented.
